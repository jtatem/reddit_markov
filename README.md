Reddit_Markov
=============

Scrapes the front page of a subreddit for comment thread links, then gathers the comments from those.  Feeds the comments into a Markov chain generator.

Markov code is mildly modified from http://agiliq.com/blog/2009/06/generating-pseudo-random-text-with-markov-chains-u/

Later there will probably be a Flask-based interface for this
